## Simple Kinode Bridge
This is a simple prototype bridge for working with kinode rollups

TODO
- Forced withdrawals (in the case of sequencer censorship)
- ZKPs (waiting on Succinct)
- Arbitrary message passing (between L1 and L2) (to allow for multiple kinds of token deposits)
- Multiple rollups sharing a single bridge to allow for cross-rollup messaging
